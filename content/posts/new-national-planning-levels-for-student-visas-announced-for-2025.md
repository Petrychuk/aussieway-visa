The Australian Government has introduced a new National Planning Level (NPL) for international student commencements, set to take effect in the 2025 calendar year. This initiative is part of broader efforts to ensure the quality and integrity of Australia’s education sector, particularly in light of growing concerns about the sustainability and impact of international student numbers on educational resources and infrastructure.

**Overview of the National Planning Level (NPL)**

The NPL for 2025 has been set at 270,000 new international student commencements. This cap is divided among the higher education sector and the vocational education and training (VET) sector, reflecting the government's strategic approach to managing the influx of international students across different educational pathways.

* **Higher Education Sector**:

  *  Publicly funded universities will accommodate 145,000 new international student commencements in 2025.
  * Other universities and non-university higher education providers will share an allocation of approximately 30,000 new international student commencements.
* **Vocational Education and Training (VET) Sector**:

  *   The VET sector will have an allocation of 90,000 new international student commencements in 2025.

This planning level is designed to maintain the balance between ensuring the quality of education provided to international students and managing the resources and capacities of educational institutions.

**Exemptions from the NPL**

Certain groups of international students are exempt from the NPL, allowing these students to pursue education in Australia without contributing to the overall cap. These exemptions include:

* School students
* Higher degree by research students
* Students undertaking standalone English language courses (ELICOS)
* Non-award students
* Australian Government sponsored scholars
* Students involved in Australian transnational education arrangements or twinning arrangements
* Key partner foreign government scholarship holders
* Students from the Pacific and Timor-Leste

**Legislative Framework and Pending Bill**

The implementation of the NPL is contingent upon the passage of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024. This bill, currently under debate in the Senate, seeks to empower the Minister to set enrolment limits on overseas students, thereby formalizing the NPL and other related measures.

The announcement of the NPL has been met with varied reactions from educational institutions and stakeholders. While it aims to preserve the integrity of Australia’s education system, it also introduces challenges for institutions that have traditionally relied heavily on international student enrolments.

For more information on the new Bill, refer to the joint media release by the Hon Jason Clare MP, the Hon Tony Burke MP, and Senator the Hon Murray Watt.
