Effective from 1 July 2024, significant updates have been introduced to the Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa (subclass 482), which are part of broader reforms aimed at improving the labor market mobility for temporary migrants and reducing worker exploitation. Here’s a breakdown of the key changes:

#### Extended Time to Find New Employment

 Visa holders who cease working with their sponsoring employer now have up to 180 consecutive days, or a maximum of 365 days across the entire visa grant period, to find a new sponsor, apply for another visa, or arrange their departure from Australia. This change provides greater flexibility and reduces the pressure on visa holders to immediately secure new employment.

#### Increased Flexibility in Employment

During this extended period, visa holders are allowed to work for other employers, even in occupations not listed in their most recently approved sponsorship nomination. However, they must ensure that they are not working in roles that require specific licenses or registrations unless they hold those credentials.

#### Sponsor Obligations

Employers sponsoring workers on subclass 482 visas must notify the Department of Home Affairs within 28 days of any changes in the employment situation, such as if a visa holder resigns or if the sponsorship is terminated. Compliance with these reporting obligations is crucial to avoid penalties.

#### Impact on Current and Future Visa Holders

These changes apply to both existing visa holders and those granted a visa on or after 1 July 2024. It's important to note that any periods during which a visa holder stopped working before 1 July 2024 will not count towards the new time periods.

These reforms are part of the Australian Government’s strategy to address worker exploitation while enhancing productivity by allowing more labor market flexibility. Employers and visa holders alike should familiarize themselves with these changes to ensure compliance and make the most of the new opportunities available under the revised conditions.
